    <h2>How my bike broke. o(╥﹏╥)o</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">
      I'm kind of nervous writing this since it's my first story! But I hope
      that you guys like it.<br />A few years back I moved back to the UK into a
      small village. I landed a job in the nearest city earlier last year, which
      was about an hour and a half away, but my mum wasn't able to give me many
      rides there so I had to get the bus or walk there. <br />I eventually got
      tired of doing this and decided to ask my grandmother if she has any spare
      bikes from my uncle, which she did! She let me have it and it was great. A
      proper mountain bike, it was brilliant for the distance to work and back,
      and for off road journeys. <br />
      All good things must come to an end though. I took this bike to an off
      road bike path on quite a big hill last winter
