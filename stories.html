    <h2>The Time My Bike Broke („Å§‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•)„Å§ </h2>
    <p>I'm a little unsure how to start this as my first story on the site, but I hope you guys like it nonetheless. o(„ÄÉÔºæ‚ñΩÔºæ„ÄÉ)o<br>As I mentioned in my About Me page, I loved to mountain bike! But unfortunately it broke T.T.<br> I was given a mountain bike as a gift from my uncle (he had it since he was younger than me, but I loved it anyways) and began to cycle everywhere, it was great! ^a^ eventually I gained the courage to do offroading. I used to cycle on one trail all the time, and jumped some of the ramps that were built there.It took some time getting used to, but I got there in the end.<br>But of course good things only last for such a time. It wasn't long until issues with the bike started to appear. THe tires got flatter, the pedals became looser, and worst of all the chain kept locking... which made it super hard to do all my great tricks! (-Ôºø- )„Éé.<br>As expected, this bike's life ended pretty shortly after the chain started to lock. With no money or experience to fix it, I eventually had to abandon it. I thought then that I'd not be able to cycle for some time, which weighed on me. Lucky for me though, my parents had some friends in the area who belonged to a local mountain biking group, and through second hand pieces, they were able to 'Frankenstein' a bike together for me! Behold, my steed has returned to me!(Ôø£‚ñ°Ôø£).<br>It only took a couple days for this bike to get to me, and it was the best thing ever. Full suspension, smooth brakes, strong tires, perfect! Oh.. the pedals are loose on this one too.. and the chain locked almost straight away.. but that's fine I guess, probably just needs to be worn into a bit I suppose..<br>That train of thought has never gone well for me, and time told. This bike couldn't handle even the simplest of shallow mud roads!! —â(‡≤•–î‡≤•—â). I couldn't land from ramps because the chain would come out of place or the wheels would loosen.. I couldn't go fast because the gears were mangled.. I could barely cycle this thing!<br>Through many stressful rides, it took one fateful winter's eve ((O‚àÜO)) for my bike to finally give in. I was offroading on my usual path until my back tire hit a misplaced rock, and the bike went flying. My immediate worry was to not let the bike go far as only a few metres to my right is a river.. I'd never get the bike back TwT<br>Luckily..or unluckily I guess, I got the bike before it fell in, and got back on to start riding, only for the pedals to fly around and hit me in the shin (possible karma for the flurry of curses I gave to the bike).<br>I thought that as usual the chain had just come out of place from the gears and could be placed back on no problem.. only there was no chain. I looked everywhere nearby but couldn't find it at all.. my only guess to this day is that it got into the river.<br>With a now unusable bike, with no money to repair or get a new bike, and grazed knees, I stop home wishing I never knew about cycling to begin with.. yet again the death of a favoured steed befalls me. ‚Åù(‡•É‚Ä¢Àá‚Ä∏Àá‚Ä¢„ÄÇ ‡•É„ÄÄ)‡•Å‚Åù.<br>Still to this day I have no <del>bike</del>steed and probably won't for some years to come. But that's why I've taken up all these other sports that I told you about!</p>
    
  <h3 style="font-size: 17px;">Hopefully you guys really enjoyed that! I'm sorry if it wasn't super good, still trying to get a hand of writing stories and making all these pages and stuffs for us! o(‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•)o. Regardless of what you all thought, I hope you all have a great day and I love you all ! ! (‡πëÀäÕà ‡•¢Íá¥ ÀãÕà)„Äú‚ô°‡•∞‡•±</h3>

     <h2>When oomf and I witnessed a REAL gangstalk! (;¬∞ „É≠¬∞)</h2>
     <p>This all happened a few weeks back when I met up with my best friend in town. We agreed to meet up and go for a nice walk along the sea, then go back in to town and visit a pub.<br>The walk was really nice! I bought some cigarettes before we left and then we started on our way. The weather was lovely, super hot, super sunny. The tide was in too so we got to see a very pretty landscape!<br>Halfway through the walk we stopped off at an inn for some lunch. My friend had mac and cheese (his usual) with cajun fries, and I got cajun fries with onion rings. We both got a pint of pepsi and enjoyed the view.<br>We walked a little farther, sharing stories and our favourite songs along the way. Oomf played some cosmic metal and some obscure ambient black metal, and I showed him some funeral doom and some prog rock.<br>We made our way back in to town, exhausted and panting for a drink. We finally made it to a pub and we both got a couple drinks each.. Ive never been so grateful for water! (Ôø£ÔπÉÔø£) It wasn't long until the work day was finished, and since it was sunny the pub started to pile up. Luckily we were sat outside and a bit far out from the crowd.<br>This didn't stop the usual suspects from coming in. We didn't have a choice in whether or not we listened in to their conversation they were that loud. Spouting the usual normie things, we ignored most of it.<br>It wasn't until one of the men started to talk about work, he was saying how "work is evil" and "we shouldn't work at all", which was pretty based. My friend and I looked at each other and laughed at this, thankfully they didn't notice.<br>Things went quiet for some time, then a middle aged man walked in to the pub, and sat right in the doorway, staring at the usual suspects. Immediately, the man talking about work stood up and started yelling about how that man was a fed and how "he follows me in to every pub I go to".<br>They left then and there and we did too laughing as we went, remarking that we both witnessed a "real gangstalk". We then made our way to the shops before relaxing outside the train station. I bought some ice cream and my frien got some butter and meat for his dinner. He left and I made my way home, thankful for another  great day with my friend  (‡πë > ·¥ó < ‡πë)¬∞·°£ê≠© . ¬∞ . !!</p>
 
   <h3 style="font-size: 17px;">This was a super funny time for me and my friend! We really enjoyed our day and had a great time on our walk talking about anime, music, and visual novels. Hope you all enjoyed! <3</h3>
