    <h2>The TIme My Bike Broke (つ╥﹏╥)つ </h2>
    <p>I'm a little unsure how to start this as my first story on the site, but I hope you guys like it nonetheless. o(〃＾▽＾〃)o<br>As I mentioned in my About Me page, I loved to mountain bike! But unfortunately it broke T.T.<br> I was given a mountain bike as a gift from my uncle (he had it since he was younger than me, but I loved it anyways) and began to cycle everywhere, it was great! ^a^ eventually I gained the courage to do offroading. I used to cycle on one trail all the time, and jumped some of the ramps that were built there.It took some time getting used to, but I got there in the end.<br>But of course good things only last for such a time. It wasn't long until issues with the bike started to appear. THe tires got flatter, the pedals became looser, and worst of all the chain kept locking... which made it super hard to do all my great tricks! (-＿- )ノ.<br>As expected, this bike's life ended pretty shortly after the chain started to lock. With no money or experience to fix it, I eventually had to abandon it. I thought then that I'd not be able to cycle for some time, which weighed on me. Lucky for me though, my parents had some friends in the area who belonged to a local mountain biking group, and through second hand pieces, they were able to 'Frankenstein' a bike together for me! Behold, my steed has returned to me!(￣□￣).<br>It only took a couple days for this bike to get to me, and it was the best thing ever. Full suspension, smooth brakes, strong tires, perfect! Oh.. the pedals are loose on this one too.. and the chain locked almost straight away.. but that's fine I guess, probably just needs to be worn into a bit I suppose..<br>That train of thought has never gone well for me, and time told. This bike couldn't handle even the simplest of shallow mud roads!! щ(ಥДಥщ). I couldn't land from ramps because the chain would come out of place or the wheels would loosen.. I couldn't go fast because the gears were mangled.. I could barely cycle this thing!<br>Through many stressful rides, it took one fateful winter's eve ((O∆O)) for my bike to finally give in. I was offroading on my usual path until my back tire hit a misplaced rock, and the bike went flying. My immediate worry was to not let the bike go far as only a few metres to my right is a river.. I'd never get the bike back TwT<br>Luckily..or unluckily I guess, I got the bike before it fell in, and got back on to start riding, only for the pedals to fly around and hit me in the shin (possible karma for the flurry of curses I gave to the bike).<br>I thought that as usual the chain had just come out of place from the gears and could be placed back on no problem.. only there was no chain. I looked everywhere nearby but couldn't find it at all.. my only guess to this day is that it got into the river.<br>With a now unusable bike, with no money to repair or get a new bike, and grazed knees, I stop home wishing I never knew about cycling to begin with.. yet again the death of a favoured steed befalls me. ⁝(ृ•ˇ‸ˇ•。 ृ　)ु⁝.<br>Still to this day I have no <del>bike</del>steed and probably won't for some years to come. But that's why I've taken up all these other sports that I told you about!</p>
