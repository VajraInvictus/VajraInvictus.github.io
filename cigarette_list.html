    <h2>Hehua Diamond</h2>
    <p>So... like I said in my About Me page, I've recently gotten really in to Hehua Diamond cigarrettes. <br>My first pack was bought at a Chinese supermarket in the closest major city to me when I went to visit my friend. I saw the packaging and recognised the lotus flowers and leaves from the blue Hehua Diamonds (which I really wanted, but they didn't have).<br>They're made with lotus seeds, which you can taste quite strongly if you're a seasoned smoker (•ᴗ<˶)✧₊ ⊹.<br>The taste is somewhat floral and quite rich. The only issue I really had with them was how small they are. They're about half the size of a regular cigarrette. The design of the filters make up for it completely though! There are small lotus flowers printed all over and they're super cute! The green line is very appealing too.<br>All in all, Hehua Diamonds are my new favourite and go to. 10/10. ヾ｜￣ー￣｜ﾉ.</p>

    <h2>Double Happiness Dotty</h2>
    <p>Now, I can't quite remember the exact name of these cigarrettes, but I know they're made by Double Happiness. I was passed one of these by a friend whilst out in town and I really enjoyed it.<br>The flavour was sweet, and the smoke was rough. Really interesting combination and made for a great smoke. ദ്ദി ˉ͈̀꒳ˉ͈́ )✧<br>Unfortunately the Chinese shop my friend got them at no longer sells them, so I can't experience it again! ToT but hey were a decent 7/10 smoke ^_^.</p>

        <h2>Double Happiness R&G</h2>
    <p>Again, I don't have all the info here ૮ ⸝⸝o̴̶̷᷄ ·̭ o̴̶̷̥᷅⸝⸝  ྀིა. I tried searching for the pack of Double Happiness cigs I had, but couldn't find a picture of them. The picrel isn't the same pack (but I'd love to have one of these ^a^).<br>The pack I had was all red with a golden strip down the middle with the Double Happiness logo in the middle. Very rich, fairly rough, and they last well. Great cigarette and it's my joined favourite with the Hehua Diamonds.<br>These were the first Chinese cigarrettes I ever smoked and I've never looked back at European or American cigarrettes since. Xi can take my lungs as well as my capitalistic tendencies!╰(°ㅂ°)╯ (10/10 btw).</p>

        <h2>Double Happiness W&R</h2>
   <p>These ones are great!!! Double Happiness Red and White. They're a lighter version of the Red and Gold cigarrettes and have the perfect flavour profile. After buying the Red and Gold packs, I saw these and wanted to try them. They beat the R&Gs by one point, making them 10/10 as well! (๑˃̶͈̀o˂̶͈́๑)</p>

 </p>
    <h2>Kent's Core</h2>
   <p>These were the very first cigarrettes I smoked when I moved back to the UK. It was late in town and I was drinking with one of my old friends when I had just met him. He bought about 2 or 3 packs and we shared them together, and when I went home I couldn't get the name Kent out of my mind.<br> The flavour is more of an aftertaste, meaning you have to take the smoke slow and really process the taste. The aftertaste is nutty, roasted, and silky („ᵕᴗᵕ„).<br>Would recommend for those who are starting to smoke. The interesting thing about these cigs is that their filter is hollow, meaning an improved airflow and bigger draw. Highly recommend. 8/10 ★~(◡‿◡✿)</p>

       <h2>Dunhill's</h2>
    <p>Ahhhh Dunhill's... I started smoking these after smoking Kent's for a while and flavour wise it was a really great choice. It was less null, and was much more like the pipe tobacco and cigars I was used to smelling growing up.<br>A perfect old man's cigarrette, guess they fit me perfect (◡﹏◡✿). These are a 10/10. They burn, taste, look, smell, and feel perfect.</p>
