        <p>First things first I guess.. you guys can call me Squid, it's a nickname I've always had<br> I'm 19 (life is already over for me I guess.. >.>) and was born in the UK. I moved to Ireland when I was about 5 and moved back in the last few years, so I've had to get used to British culture again, despite what little participation I had.</p>
        
        <p>My birthday is in February! But somehow despite being born in the month of love, I can't find any TwT<br>I raelly like to hike and other outdoors stuffs. I used to mountain bike until my bike got broken (Maybe that can be the first story I tell ^^), so in it's stead I do off road jogging/running, yoga, and when I can I like to swim!</p>
        <p>Things are hard for money because I'm a neet and the stupid zogt won't give me money for existing! .0. how rude... I'm fine with having little though. When I do get money I like to see my friend who is very nice! I've only known him for about 6 or so months but it feels like a lifetime. I've never had many friends, and I'm very grateful to have him as my only. I also like to buy cigarrettes (my favourite are Chinese ones. Recently I've gotten into Hehua Diamonds) and  I always buy books too.</p>
    
        <p> I'd like to think I read a lot, but I've got some years of being terminally online to make up for. I usually read things on philosophy and religion. The last book I fully read was the Baghavad Gita and I loved it. I've a whole list of other books (which I can add somewhere else on the site!) that I've got to read after though... tough work... >_></p>
        <p>Aside from physical books, I also play visual novels! I've always been exposed to them, even as a kid, but just never really understood them until as of late. My friend plays them a lot and he keeps telling me they're good, so I gave a look at one of his suggestions and it is really good! Perhaps I'll upload another page of my playthrough.</p>
        <p>In line with the VNs, I also read manga and watch anime. I also love to look at anime art (and art in general, I'll poast some of my favs) and follow loads of artists on Xitter lol.</p>
       
        <p>Let me know if I should add more! Love you guys ! ! < 3 \(´▽｀*)(*´▽｀)/ </p>
